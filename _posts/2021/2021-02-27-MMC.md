### [ Response Type ]

- No Response
- R1/R1b (Normal Response Command)
  - R1: read case
  - R1b: write case (명령 이후, CMD13 통해 수행 상태 확인)
- R2 (CID, CSD Registers)
- R3 (OCR Register)
- R4 (Fast I/O)
- R5 (Interrupt Request)

 

### [ RCA (2 bytes) ]

- The writable 16-bit relative device address register

  >  default value: 0x0001

  

### [ CSD (16 bytes) ]

- Device Specific Data, information about the Device operation conditions



### [ EXT_CSD (512 bytes) ]

- Extended Device Specific Data



- HS_TIMING [185]

  > timing and driver strength
  >
  > HS_TIMING must be set to "0x1" before setting BUS_WIDTH for dual data rate operation (5 or 6)

  - Selected Driver Strength [4:7] (4 bits)
  - Timing Interface [0:3] (4 bits)

    | Value | Timing Interface |
    | ----- | ---------------- |
    | 0x1   | High Speed       |
    | 0x2   | HS200            |
    | 0x3   | HS400            |

    

- BUS_WIDTH [183]

  > Bus mode value
  >
  > It is set to '0' after power up and can be changed by a SWITCH command

  | Value | Bus Mode                        |
  | ----- | ------------------------------- |
  | 6     | 8 bit data bus (dual data rate) |
  | 5     | 4 bit data bus (dual data rate) |
  | 2     | 8 bit data bus                  |
  | 1     | 4 bit data bus                  |
  | 0     | 1 bit data bus                  |
