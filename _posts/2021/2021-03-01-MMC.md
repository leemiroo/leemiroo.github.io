### [ Block/Queue Driver ]

- `driver/mmc/core/queue.c`
  - <u>receive block read/write/erase requests</u>
  - picks up one request from its queue and assign it to mmc block driver
- `drivers/mmc/core/block.c`
  - analyze the type of request and forwards the request to mmc core driver



### [ Core Driver ]

- `driver/mmc/core/core.c`
  - <u>protocol implementation</u> for eMMC/SD devices detection
  - enumeration and data transfers to <u>communicated with the actual hardware</u> devices
  - receives the request from block driver, prepares a *mmc_request* and forwards it to the mmc host driver
- `drivers/mmc/core/mmc.c`
- `drivers/mmc/core/sd.c`



### [ Host Driver ]

- `drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c`
  - initiates the transfer to device by <u>programming hardware controller registers</u>
  - once the request get processed by the hardware controller, an interrupt gets generated
  - <u>receives request complete interrupt</u>, analyzes it
  - pass the response to block driver
